# Home Hunt - Property Listing Platform

## Description

Home Hunt is a small project focused on allowing users to sign up and create listings for their properties in Bahrain. These listings can be viewed by others who might be interested in renting. The project is built using Angular for the frontend and ASP.NET for the backend.

## Why Am I Working on This?

I'm working on this project to sharpen my skills in both Angular and ASP.NET. By integrating these two technologies in a real-world scenario, I'm aiming to improve my full-stack development capabilities, particularly in handling user authentication, data management, and API communication.

To run this project, ensure you have both Node.js and .NET installed on your machine.
